# Examples

The easiest thing to do is arguably to start with an example,
and then customize it. Here we will add examples as we create them.

- [minikube](https://github.com/converged-computing/flux-cloud/tree/main/examples/minikube)
  - [basic](https://github.com/converged-computing/flux-cloud/tree/main/examples/minikube/basic)
  - [volumes](https://github.com/converged-computing/flux-cloud/tree/main/examples/minikube/volumes)
  - [resources](https://github.com/converged-computing/flux-cloud/tree/main/examples/minikube/resources)

All of the examples above (for MiniKube) are tested. New examples for Google Cloud and AWS will be coming soon.
