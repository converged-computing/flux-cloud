# Documentation

Until we format this into documentation proper, these scattered markdown
files will serve to hold notes and documentation (that will be converted to
something prettier). Note that flux-cloud currently just works for 
google cloud, and was created to run a small set of experiments!

 - [install](install.md): brief notes on installation steps
 - [flux-cloud](cli.md): is documentation for the flux-cloud client.
